1. Start by creating a hocs and components folder

2. Then create the hoc.js file and write out the function explaining hocs are functions that return a component that wraps the passed in component adding additional functionality or props

3. create the DisplayName file and write out the logic showing that we can render whatever props are passed in

- render DisplayName in App and make sure the class understands the order in which things are invoked before moving on

4. Next create the Filter component and the withData files

5. Start by filling out the withData component and explain that this would work as a way to cache data and it's the source of truth for the data

6. then create the filter component and build out the functionality explaining that it's only concerned with the filtering the data and not the actual getting of the data

7. finish by rendering out the Filter component in app.js
